# BACKEND

This folder is intended for backend services, APIs, and data processing for the Viora Wedding Planning project.

Current contents:

- `3.TXT` - (unknown content)
- `new_file.txt` - placeholder file added by the assistant

Suggested next steps:

- Add a backend framework (Flask, FastAPI, Express, etc.) in its own subfolder.
- Include a `requirements.txt` or `package.json` depending on language.
- Add documentation for how to run the backend locally and how to run tests.

Replace this file with more detailed instructions specific to your backend implementation.
